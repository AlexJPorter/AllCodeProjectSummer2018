# PandeMonsterium
This was a long project that I completed with two others that spanned the entire semester.
It was turned in twice, once during midterms (Release 1) and again after final exams (Release 2). Release 2 is considered the final version of the program.
This project required a proposal, html documentation, use of git, and a few other deliverables. For any questions, email alexjporter@outlook.com.

This is a simple game where two players can choose a team of monsters with different stats and fight each other. They can also fight against the computer and level up by fighting more difficult enemies. There's also an item shop where the player can buy upgrades.
