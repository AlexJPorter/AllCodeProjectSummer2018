I used python to solve a few math problems involving graphs. 

The largest of these, is the "crazy" Euler circuit finder. Given a graph represented as an adjaceny matrix, return the Euler circuit
if there is one. There are a few others in here also, but those are simple compartively. 

Because of this program, and the others listed here, I was the only person in my class to receive an A.
